## Shaft_Engine (GUI & API TESTS)

This project aims to perform GUI and API tests using Shaft_Engine, a test automation engine built on top of Selenium and RestAssured. The tests are designed to validate the functionality and performance of specific web applications and APIs.

## GUI TEST: Testing SourceLabs Website

The GUI test focuses on testing the SourceLabs website, accessible at [https://www.saucedemo.com/](https://www.saucedemo.com/). The end-to-end scenario includes the following steps:

1. **Login**: Verify the login functionality by logging into the website.
2. **Search Product**: Perform a search for a specific product.
3. **Add Product to Cart**: Validate the capability to add a product to the shopping cart.

The GUI test ensures that the website's key functionalities are working as expected and provides a comprehensive end-to-end validation of the user journey.

## API Test: Testing Restful Booker Web API

The API test focuses on testing a web API called Restful Booker, accessible at [https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/). The test scenarios involve the following operations:

1. **GET**: Verify the functionality of the HTTP GET method.
2. **POST**: Validate the capability to create resources using the HTTP POST method.
3. **UPDATE**: Test the ability to update resources using the HTTP PUT method.
4. **DELETE**: Ensure the proper deletion of resources using the HTTP DELETE method.

The API test aims to assess the reliability, correctness, and performance of the Restful Booker API by covering essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## How to Run the Tests

To execute the GUI and API tests using Shaft_Engine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/hai-prog/Shaft_Engine`
2. Install the required dependencies mentioned in the project's documentation.
3.  you need to edit your run configuration templates before running your tests by following these steps:
   - Open 'Edit Run/Debug Configurations' dialog > Edit Configurations... > Edit configuration templates...
   - Select TestNG > Listeners > and add these listeners one by one:
     com.shaft.listeners.TestNGListener
   - Select Cucumber Java > Program Arguments > and add this argument:
   --plugin com.shaft.listeners.CucumberFeatureListener
   - After saving the changes, remember to delete any old test runs you may have triggered by mistake before adding the needed config. â†©
7. Execute the test files individually or run them together as a suite.
8. Monitor the test execution and review the test reports generated by Shaft_Engine.

Make sure to review the documentation of Shaft_Engine for additional details on test execution, reporting, and customization options.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following dependencies:

- Shaft_Engine: The test automation engine used to perform GUI and API tests
                 on the tob of :
     - Selenium: A popular web automation framework for browser interaction.
     - RestAssured: A Java library for testing and validating RESTful web services.
     - Other necessary libraries and frameworks as specified in the project's configuration or requirements files.

Ensure that the correct versions of these dependencies are installed and configured to successfully run the tests.

## Conclusion

The Shaft_Engine(GUI & API TESTS) project aims to provide a comprehensive testing solution for GUI and API testing using the Shaft_Engine automation engine. The GUI tests focus on the SourceLabs website, while the API tests target the Restful Booker web API. By leveraging Selenium and RestAssured, the project ensures thorough testing of key functionalities, enabling you to validate the performance and reliability of the tested systems.
Happy testing!
